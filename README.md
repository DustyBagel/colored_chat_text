# Colored Chat Text
This mod makes the minetest chat messages a different color depending on what you set it to in the settings. It's great for people who have trouple seeing the bright white text that the default minetest chat provides or if you just want to change the chat color to mix it up a bit. I want to add support for other things like private messages and other chat commands later as well as other chat mods. I have no idea when thought as it depends on when I can find the time and figure out how to do it.

This mod was inspired by the Colored Chat mod which can be found here:
