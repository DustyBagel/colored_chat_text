#   The color of messages sent in the chat. This only works for 
#messages sent to everyone currnetly but that may change in the future. 
#The color can be set as just the word for that color 
#like green or you can put in the hex color code for the color you want. 
#If you set the color to something and the text is still white then it 
#is likely because the setting was set incorrectly.
